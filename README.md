# Users Aims
A way for researchers who range from early-late career to undestand and use biology data through adapters with Biocypher. Usually they come with a Biologically-driven question. Whether Biocypher or adapters it connects to can solve that is their main and first goal.

"The user should not have to know about the technical intricacies behind, for instance, the identifier overlap and harmonisation between drugbank, chembl, and clinicaltrials resources. They want to answer a biologically driven question, and they don't have education in ontologies or IT technology."

So the user really jsut wants a way to view the few relevant adapters/data and understand from examples how to apply it, and even, where possible, how to apply it to their research question.
